# CryptoClustering
The main objective of this challenge was to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes.

**Preparing the Data**

1- I Used the StandardScaler() module from scikit-learn to normalize the data from the CSV file.

2- Then created a DataFrame with the scaled data and set the "coin_id" index from the original DataFrame as the index for the new DataFrame.

**Requirements:**

Finding the K value from the original data.

Find the Best Value for k Using the Original Scaled DataFrame and Use the elbow method to find the best value for k

Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the Original Scaled Data

Optimize Clusters with Principal Component Analysis.

Find the Best Value for k Using the PCA Data.

Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the PCA Data.
